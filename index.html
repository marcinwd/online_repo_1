                The screen door slams, Mary's dress sways<br>
                Like a vision she dances across the porch as the radio plays<br>
                Roy Orbison singing for the lonely<br>
                Hey that's me and I want you only<br>
                Don't turn me home again<br>
                I just can't face myself alone again<br>
                Don't run back inside, darling you know just what I'm here for<br>
                So you're scared and you're thinking that maybe we ain't that young anymore<br>
                Show a little faith, there's magic in the night<br>
                You ain't a beauty, but hey you're alright<br>
                Oh and that's alright with me<br>
            </p>
            
            <p class="text">
                You can hide 'neath your covers and study your pain<br>
                Make crosses from your lovers, throw roses in the rain<br>
                Waste your summer praying in vain for a savior to rise from these streets<br>
                Well now I'm no hero, that's understood<br>
                All the redemption I can offer, girl, is beneath this dirty hood<br>
                With a chance to make it good somehow<br>
                Hey what else can we do now
                Except roll down the window and let the wind blow back your hair<br>
                Well the night's busting open, these two lanes will take us anywhere<br>
                We got one last chance to make it real<br>
                To trade in these wings on some wheels<br>
                Climb in back, heaven's waiting down on the tracks
            </p> 
            <p class="text">
                Oh oh come take my hand<br>
                Riding out tonight to case the promised land<br>
                Oh oh oh oh Thunder Road, oh Thunder Road, oh Thunder Road<br>
                Lying out there like a killer in the sun<br>
                Hey I know it's late, we can make it if we run<br>
                Oh oh oh oh Thunder Road, sit tight, take hold, Thunder Road
            </p>
            <p class="text">  
                Well I got this guitar and I learned how to make it talk<br>
                And my car's out back if you're ready to take that long walk<br>
                From your front porch to my front seat<br>
                The door's open but the ride it ain't free<br>
                And I know you're lonely for words that I ain't spoken<br>
                Tonight we'll be free, all the promises will be broken<br>
                There were ghosts in the eyes of all the boys you sent away<br>
                They haunt this dusty beach road in the skeleton frames of burned-out Chevrolets<br>
                They scream your name at night in the street<br>
                Your graduation gown lies in rags at their feet<br>
                And in the lonely cool before dawn<br>
                You hear their engines roaring on<br>
                But when you get to the porch they're gone on the wind, so Mary climb in<br>
                It's a town full of losers, I'm pulling out of here to win
